/*
 * Nagle's algorithm: Means to improve efficiency of TCP/IP networks by reducing
 * the number of packets that need to be sent over the network. 
 * Application repeatedly emits data in small chunks causing huge overhead. 
 * Nagle's algorithm works by combining a number of small outgoing messages 
 * and sending them all at once. Specifically, as long as there is a sent 
 * packet for which the sender has received an ack, the sender should keep
 * buffering its output until it has a full packet's worth of output, 
 * thus allowing output to be sent all at once.
